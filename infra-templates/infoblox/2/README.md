By default DNS entries are named `<service>.<stack>.<environment>.<domain>`.
You can specify a custom name template used to construct the subdomain part (left of the domain/zone name) of the DNS records. The following placeholders are supported:

* `%{{service_name}}`
* `%{{stack_name}}`
* `%{{environment_name}}`

**Example:**

`%{{stack_name}}-%{{service_name}}.statictext`

Make sure to only use characters in static text and separators that your provider allows in DNS names.
