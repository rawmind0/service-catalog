### Service configuration labels:

Traefik labels has to be added to your services, in order to get included in traefik config.

#### Metadata or api

Please use traefik defined labels if you choose metadata or api rancher integration. 

[Traefik rancher backend labels][traefik rancher backend]

Metadata is the prefered and recommended rancher integration.

#### External

Use this labels if you choose extenal rancher integration.

- traefik.enable = < true | stack | false > #Controls if you want to publish or not the service
  - true: the service will be published as *service_name.stack_name.traefik_domain*
  - stack: the service will be published as *stack_name.domain*. WARNING: You can have collisions inside services within your stack
  - false: the service will not be published
- traefik.priority = <priority>             # Override for frontend priority. Default `5`

- traefik.alias.fqdn = < alias fqdn >                   # Alternate names to route rule. Multiple values separated by ",". traefik.domain must be defined but is not appended here.
- traefik.domain = < domain.name >          # Domain names to route rules. Multiple domains separated by ","
- traefik.domain.regexp = < domain.regexp > # Domain name regexp rule. Multiple domains separated by ","
- traefik.port = <port>                     # port to expose throught traefik. Default `80`
- traefik.acme = < true | false >           # Enable/disable ACME traefik feature. Default `false`

- traefik.ratelimit.burst = < n >           # State what limit the client ip is allowed to burst up to respectively. Default `200`

WARNING: Only services with healthy state are added to traefik, so health checks are mandatory.

### Usage:

 Select Traefik from catalog.

 Set the params.

 Click deploy.

 Access your traefik admin service at $admin_port to see your published services.

Note: To access the services, you need to create A or CNAMES dns entries for every one.

### Usage examples

#### Setup Traefik for a custom domain

You must set these labels for the service your want to expose:
- traefik.enable = true
- traefik.port = 8080
- traefik.acme = true
- traefik.frontend.rule = Host:MyCustoDomain.com (`api` or `metadata` rancher integration)
- traefik.domain = MyCustoDomain.com (`external` rancher integration)

### F.A.Q

#### Q: Traefik doesn't apply labels

Depending on traefik rancher integration, available labels are differents.
- [api and metadata][traefik rancher backend]
- [external][rancher-traefik]

#### Q: Traefik doesn't expose my service

Depending on Traefik configuration we can diffenciate two cases:
- If you configured Traefik with label *rancher_healthcheck=true* -> ensure your service has a healthcheck
- If you configured Traefik without healthcheck, then check the Traefik log. Some times Traefik fails when try to load an invalid config and, before that, doesn't load new services -> restart Traefik should fix that
